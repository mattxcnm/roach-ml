# Roach-ML: Collection of Machine Learning Functions and Examples
Machine learning algorithms, functions, and various examples written in Python by Matthew A. Roach adapted from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville Machine Learning course COSC522.

## Purpose + Summary
This repository serves as the storage location for all homework assignments, projects, and machine learning code generated through the Machine Learning course COSC522. The directories in this repository are organized by assignment and may include duplicate code blocks across assignments and files. There are collections of reused functions and those are updated in specific locations outlined below.

The goal of this repository is not for use beyond the course detailed above. This repository will be combined into a new directory by the end of the Fall 2021 semester and made publicly available for use in machine learning environments. This will include all the fucntions developed through the COSC522 course in more robust forms for wide-range use. There will also be re-worked assignments and projects for example using the refined functions.
